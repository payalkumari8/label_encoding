# Project Outline 

Label Encoding refers to converting the label into a numeric form so to convert them into machine readable form.It is an important
pre-processing step for the structured dataset in supervised learning.

In this project there is a two way approach shown to use label encoding for datasets.
Approach 1: scikit-learn library
Approach 2: Category codes


Here is the quick guide link for label encoding :
